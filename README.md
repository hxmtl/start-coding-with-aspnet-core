# [Start Coding With ASP.NET Core][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


It's never been a better time to get started with ASP.NET. Not only has the ASP.NET team redesigned the framework from the ground up, but they've made it completely open source and cross-platform. It's now called ASP.NET Core, and with it you can develop and run ASP.NET applicati  ons on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

In this course, instructor and ASP.NET expert Jeremy McPeak will teach you everything you need to know to get started developing web apps with the latest version of ASP.NET. Follow along and you'll learn how to setup your dev environment, how to use templates and routing with MVC, and how to implement data display and editing. All this as you build a simple but functional online database of guitar types!
